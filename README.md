# flask-blog:
This is a Blog site made using Flask
The functionality is minimal and there is currently no application security.

# STATUS of Project: To be continued after April 2021:

### TODO-

- Use sqlalchemy with SQL(preferably something that works with my deployment)
- Try to use `Flask-Frozen` and github-pages
- Add application security, with limited access to admin panel
- Add comment feature
AND MORE...!
